# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# Milestone 1 - Project Overview :
The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project aims to build a fully-functional e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)
Key Features :
User Authentication: Secure user login and registration functionality.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders with backend integration.
REST API: Build scalable and secure APIs for communication between client and server.
MongoDB Schema Design: Design and implement structured data models for managing users, products, and orders.
Tech Stack :
Frontend : React.js
Backend : Node.js, Express.js
Database : MongoDB
Authentication : JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
Introduction to MERN Stack : You gained an understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and its role in building full-stack web applications. The lesson highlighted the advantages of using JavaScript across both the frontend and backend, simplifying development.
Project Overview : You were introduced to the goals and key features of the "Ecommerce-Follow-Along" project, which includes user authentication, product management, and order handling, all built with the MERN stack.
API Structure and Endpoints : You learned about REST APIs and how they enable communication between the client and server. Key endpoints will be built for user registration, login, product management, and order handling.
Database Schema Design : The importance of schema design in MongoDB was covered, with a focus on creating structured models for data like users, products, and orders.
Authentication Basics : You learned the significance of user authentication in web applications, ensuring secure access to sensitive resources like purchases and personal information.

# Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page
This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure and implementing a basic login page.
Key Features

Login Page: A simple login page with fields for username and password.
Tech Stack Used
Frontend: React, Tailwindcss

# Milestone 3: Server setup and error handling.
Key Features:
Organized backend code with a clear folder structure.
Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle APIs.
Integrated MongoDB for data storage and management.
Implemented basic error handling for smooth server operations.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose

# Milestone 4: User Management System with File Upload
This project is a simple User Management System that allows the creation, retrieval, and management of user data. It also supports file uploads (like profile pictures) using Multer.
Features
User Model: Blueprint for storing user data in the database.
User Controller: Manages operations like adding, retrieving, and updating user information.
File Uploads: Accepts and stores user-uploaded files (e.g., profile images).
Documentation: Well-documented code for ease of

# Milestone 5: Project Signup Setup
This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure and implementing a basic signup page.
Key Features
Project Setup: Initialized the project with the required dependencies and folder structure.
Signup Page: A simple signup page with fields for Name Email Password User Photo.
Tech Stack Used
- Frontend: React

# Milestone 6: This milestone focus on the password Encryption and User Data Storage
Key Features
   1:Password Encryption: Used bcrypt to hash passwords.
   2:User Data Storage: Saved user data securely in the user inputs.
Tech stack used :
Backend : node.js

# Milestone 7: In this milestone we are going to create a backend endpoint for user and the focus is on validating user credentials and verifying the encrypted password stored in the database.
Key features:
validate user credentials during login: Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised. Privacy: Ensures passwords aren't stored in plain text. Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS. Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.
compare the encrypted password with the user’s input: User Enters Credentials:
The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database:
The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username. If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords:
Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password. If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.
Tech stalk: Backend : bcryptjs.

# Milestone 8: In this milestone, we will create a frontend card component for products and design a homepage to display these cards for each product.
Key features:
create a card component: Showcase Products Effectively: Presents product details in a clear and visually appealing way. Reusable Design: Can be used across multiple pages or sections of the app. Improved User Experience: Makes it easy for users to browse and interact with products. Organized Layout: Keeps the homepage clean and structured.
display those cards on the products page: Create a Dynamic Component: Design a single card component that accepts product details as props. Use Mapping: Use array mapping to iterate over the product list and render a card for each product. Pass Data Dynamically: Pass unique product information (e.g., name, price, image) to each card. Maintain Consistency: Ensure the layout remains uniform for all products.
Tech stack : Frontend: react

# Milestone 9 : In this milestone, we will create a Createproduct page using react.
Key features:
We can add and remove images from the webpage.
We can preview images.
We can add our names and descriptions on it.
We can specify content based on category.
We can specify tags.
We can specify prices range.
We can include our preferred stock.
We can add our e-mail.
Tech Stack : React

# Milestone 10 : In this we will create a mongoose schema for products and create and endpoint to store the product details.
Key features :
Wrote a product schema.
Create an end point to validate and store product details in mongodb.
Defined the structure of product data (e.g., name, description, price, image URL) using Mongoose. -Ensure each field has proper validation (e.g., required fields, correct data types).
Built a POST endpoint to receive product data.
Validated and saved the product details to MongoDB.
Ensured that only valid data is saved in the database, maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.
Tech Stack : React - frontend - multer.js, controller-product.js, model-product.js

# Milestone 11 : In this milestone, we will make our home page that will display all the products dynamic.
