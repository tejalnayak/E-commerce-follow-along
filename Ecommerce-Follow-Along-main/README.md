# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# Milestone 1 - Project Overview :
The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project aims to build a fully-functional e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)
Key Features :
User Authentication: Secure user login and registration functionality.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders with backend integration.
REST API: Build scalable and secure APIs for communication between client and server.
MongoDB Schema Design: Design and implement structured data models for managing users, products, and orders.
Tech Stack :
Frontend : React.js
Backend : Node.js, Express.js
Database : MongoDB
Authentication : JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
Introduction to MERN Stack : You gained an understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and its role in building full-stack web applications. The lesson highlighted the advantages of using JavaScript across both the frontend and backend, simplifying development.

# Milestone 7: In this milestone we are going to create a backend endpoint for user and the focus is on validating user credentials and verifying the encrypted password stored in the database.
Key features:
validate user credentials during login: Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised. Privacy: Ensures passwords aren't stored in plain text. Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS. Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.
compare the encrypted password with the userâ€™s input: User Enters Credentials:
The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database:
The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username. If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords:
Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password. If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.
Tech stalk: Backend : bcryptjs.
