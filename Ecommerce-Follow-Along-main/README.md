# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# Milestone 1 - Project Overview :
The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project aims to build a fully-functional e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)
Key Features :
User Authentication: Secure user login and registration functionality.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders with backend integration.
REST API: Build scalable and secure APIs for communication between client and server.
MongoDB Schema Design: Design and implement structured data models for managing users, products, and orders.
Tech Stack :
Frontend : React.js
Backend : Node.js, Express.js
Database : MongoDB
Authentication : JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
Introduction to MERN Stack : You gained an understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and its role in building full-stack web applications. The lesson highlighted the advantages of using JavaScript across both the frontend and backend, simplifying development.
Project Overview : You were introduced to the goals and key features of the "Ecommerce-Follow-Along" project, which includes user authentication, product management, and order handling, all built with the MERN stack.
API Structure and Endpoints : You learned about REST APIs and how they enable communication between the client and server. Key endpoints will be built for user registration, login, product management, and order handling.
Database Schema Design : The importance of schema design in MongoDB was covered, with a focus on creating structured models for data like users, products, and orders.
Authentication Basics : You learned the significance of user authentication in web applications, ensuring secure access to sensitive resources like purchases and personal information.

Tech stack used :
Backend : node.js

# Milestone 7: In this milestone we are going to create a backend endpoint for user and the focus is on validating user credentials and verifying the encrypted password stored in the database.
Key features:
validate user credentials during login: Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised. Privacy: Ensures passwords aren't stored in plain text. Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS. Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.
compare the encrypted password with the user’s input: User Enters Credentials:
The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database:
The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username. If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords:
Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password. If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.
Tech stalk: Backend : bcryptjs.
